# freeCodeCamp Algorithm Testing
A repository containing solutions to freeCodeCamp's algorithms challenges. Primarily for practicing writing unit tests on functions/functional components.

## Short-Term Goal
Implement unit tests for several algorithm challenges, and solve or re-solve these challenges with a BDD/TDD approach.

## Future
Convert into a web application based on teaching the concept of unit testing. Users will be given problems and several potentially incomplete solutions, and will write tests to validate whether or not the solution is correct!

## Dependencies
This project uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com) to test algorithms in Node. ES6 is supported via [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
