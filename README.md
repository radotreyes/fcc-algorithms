# How to Pull the Smoke Alarm
Platform for teaching BDD/TDD concepts via guided problem solving.

## Short-Term Goal
Implement unit tests for several algorithm challenges, and solve or re-solve these challenges with a BDD/TDD approach.

## Future
Convert into a web application based on teaching the concept of testing and BDD/TDD (behavior/test-driven development). Users will be given problems and several potentially incomplete solutions, and will write tests to validate whether or not the solution is correct!

## Dependencies
This project uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com) to test algorithms in Node. ES6 is supported via [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
